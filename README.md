# LinkeBot

**A small bot for automating a Linkedin profile**

This is a first attempt to create a bot capable of managing a LinkedIn profile. It uses [Selenium WebDriver package](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) and, since it is written for being used with [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/it/firefox/new/) browser, [GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases).

This bot is designed to get the credentials of the LinkedIn profile from an external `.txt` file so that anyone can change the used profile -or its password - without the need of modifying the source code. Said file has to be put in the same folder with the others LinkeBot's `.py` files.
