# LinkeBot
A small bot for automating a Linkedin profile

This is a first attempt to create a bot capable of managing a LinkedIn profile. It uses [Selenium WebDriver package](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) and, since it is written for being used with Mozilla Firefox browser, [GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases).
